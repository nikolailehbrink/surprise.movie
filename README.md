## üíª Running Locally

Before running the site locally, you will need to obtain an API key from TMDB (The Movie Database). This key is essential for fetching movie data from the TMDB API.

### Obtaining TMDB API Key

1. Create an account or log in to TMDB at [TMDB API Reference](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/authentication#api-key-quick-start).
2. Navigate to your account settings and select the API section.
3. Follow the instructions to request an API key.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Once you have your TMDB API key, you need to set it up in your local environment:

1. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following line to the file:
   ```bash
   VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   ```
3. Replace `your_tmdb_api_key` with the actual API key you obtained from TMDB.

### Starting the Application

After setting up the API key, you can run the application locally by following these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikolailehbrink/surprise.movie
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd surprise.movie
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
